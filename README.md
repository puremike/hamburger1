Here is a hamburger website I created. A website that uses a menu button and a side bar and that is very responsive. Here are the steps I took when creating the hamburger website:

Firstly, I downloaded a menu btn from fontawesome, and included it in my index.html file. I styled it with CSS to reduce the size and also add a hover functionality to it.

Secondly, I proceeded to creating other aspects of the website including the header, main, and footer. In the header section, I have the menu btn, the navigation bar (including the Home, Projects, About, Contact), each linking to a specific URL.

Thirdly, beneath the header and main, I created an aside element, which contain another header and navigation - same header and navigation), and has an ID #sidebar, which i used to style the sidebar section when the menu btn is clicked.

Fourthly, I proceed to creating my main section and included all the paragraphs required.

Lastly, I created the footer section which contain &copy: Michael Egbinola

I have successfully completed the project with HTML and CSS
